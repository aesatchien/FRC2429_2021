# FRC2429_2021

Stripped-down version of the 2020 Python code for our robot.  This is a work in progress (Jan-March 2021) designed to integrate the robot simulation of autonomous and pathweaver with jupyter notebooks testing our code.   Maintined by CJH.

Clone the git and install on your own machine:
Use "git clone https://github.com/aesatchien/FRC2429_2020.git" from the git bash shell to download.
If you don't have git and you just want to look at the code, you can download the repository from the links on the right.

Notes on how to install python and the necessary accessories that will get all of this running:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W679sj9CLOkiDFmzm6XB7qWhNopZQdBrFIUEkC-TWZM/edit?usp=sharing but may be a bit cryptic.  I'll help if you need it.

Once everything is installed, you need to go to the folder with robot.py.  From there, commands like

```python robot.py sim```

should bring up the simulator and allow you to check to see if your gamepad is recognized and (soon) should be able to let you drive a virtual robot around the field.
